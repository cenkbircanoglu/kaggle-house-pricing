    "In the above example, we have made use of `NDArrayIter`, which is useful for iterating\nover both numpy ndarrays and MXNet NDArrays. In general, there are different types of iterators in\nMXNet and you can use one based on the type of data you are processing.\nDocumentation for iterators can be found [here](http://mxnet.io/api/python/io.html).\n\n## MXNet Classes\n\n1. **IO:** The IO class as we already saw works on the data and carries out\n   operations such as feeding data in batches and shuffling.\n   \n2. **Symbol:** The actual MXNet neural network is composed using symbols. MXNet has\n   different types of symbols, including variable placeholders for input data,\n   neural network layers, and operators that manipulate NDArrays.\n\n3. **Module:** The module class in MXNet is used to define the overall computation.\n\tIt is initialized with the model we want to train, the training inputs (data and labels)\n\tand some additional parameters such as learning rate and the optimization\n\talgorithm to use.\n\n## Defining the Model\n\nMXNet uses **Symbols** for defining a model. Symbols are the building blocks \nand make up various components of the model. Symbols are used to define:\n\n1. **Variables:** A variable is a placeholder for future data. This symbol is used\n   to define a spot which will be filled with training data/labels in the future\n   when we commence training.\n2. **Neural Network Layers:** The layers of a network or any other type of model are\n   also defined by Symbols. Such a symbol takes one or more previous symbols as\n   inputs, performs some transformations on them, and creates one or more outputs.\n   One such example is the `FullyConnected` symbol which specifies a fully connected\n   layer of a neural network.\n3. **Outputs:** Output symbols are MXNet's way of defining a loss. They are\n   suffixed with the word \"Output\" (eg. the `SoftmaxOutput` layer). You can also\n   [create your own loss function](https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/blob/master/docs/tutorials/r/CustomLossFunction.md#how-to-use-your-own-loss-function).\n   Some examples of existing losses are: `LinearRegressionOutput`, which computes\n   the l2-loss between it's input symbol and the labels provided to it;\n   `SoftmaxOutput`, which computes the categorical cross-entropy.\n\nThe ones described above and other symbols are chained together with the output of\none symbol serving as input to the next to build the network topology. More information\nabout the different types of symbols can be found [here](http://mxnet.io/api/python/symbol.html)."

    "The above network uses the following layers:\n\n1. `FullyConnected`: The fully connected symbol represents a fully connected layer\n   of a neural network (without any activation being applied), which in essence,\n   is just a linear regression on the input attributes. It takes the following\n   parameters:\n\n   - `data`: Input to the layer (specifies the symbol whose output should be fed here)\n   - `num_hidden`: Number of hidden neurons in the layer, which is same as the dimensionality\n     of the layer's output\n\n2. `LinearRegressionOutput`: Output layers in MXNet compute training loss, which is\n\tthe measure of inaccuracy in the model's predictions. The goal of training is to minimize the\n\ttraining loss. In our example, the `LinearRegressionOutput` layer computes the *l2* loss against\n\tits input and the labels provided to it. The parameters to this layer are:\n\n   - `data`: Input to this layer (specifies the symbol whose output should be fed here)\n   - `label`: The training labels against which we will compare the input to the layer for calculation of l2 loss\n\n**Note on naming convention:** the label variable's name should be the same as the\n`label_name` parameter passed to your training data iterator. The default value of\nthis is `softmax_label`, but we have updated it to `lin_reg_label` in this\ntutorial as you can see in `Y = mx.symbol.Variable('lin_reg_label')` and\n`train_iter = mx.io.NDArrayIter(..., label_name='lin_reg_label')`.\n\nFinally, the network is input to a *Module*, where we specify the symbol\nwhose output needs to be minimized (in our case, `lro` or the `lin_reg_output`), the\nlearning rate to be used while optimization and the number of epochs we want to\ntrain our model for."
